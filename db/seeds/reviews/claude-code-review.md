Claude Code is Anthropic's coding agent that lives in your terminal. Unlike a chat window you paste snippets into, it reads and edits files in your actual project, runs commands, and works through multi-step tasks on its own — closer to pairing with a fast junior engineer than using an autocomplete.

What stands out is how well it holds the thread on real work. Point it at a bug and it will explore the codebase, form a plan, make changes across several files, and run the tests — narrating as it goes. On larger refactors it stays coherent where lighter tools lose the plot. The underlying model's reasoning is the differentiator.

The catch: this is a developer tool. You need to be comfortable in a terminal, and because it works through the API, long autonomous sessions cost real money — keep an eye on usage. And like any agent, it needs supervision: read its diffs before you commit, especially on anything destructive. It is not a tool for non-coders.

On privacy, Anthropic does not train on your code by default, which matters if you're pointing it at proprietary work — but confirm the current policy for your account type.

Verdict: for developers who live in the terminal, it's the most capable coding agent we've used. For everyone else, start with a chat assistant instead. Five stars — with the honest caveat that "five stars for developers" is the right way to read it.
